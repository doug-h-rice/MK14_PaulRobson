           Using MK14,MK14G and WK14 - the portable emulator
           =================================================

These are three ports of the MK14 "C" emulator. One is for Windows, two
are for DOS (one uses Graphics, one uses Text Mode)

To compile the emulators you need to link CPU.C MEMORY.C and MAIN.C or
MINMAIN.C to a suitable DRV_xxx.C file for your OS. A file for DOS is
provided. The DOS port was written in Borland Turbo C v2.0

The Windows port involves linking CPU.C and MEMORY.C with MK14W.C which
provides the functions of both Main.C and Drv_Win.C. This was compiled
using Borland Turbo C++ v4.5

Porting is relatively simple. The EGA port took about 20 minutes to
write, the Windows one only slightly longer. The hardest bit is emulating
the key presses due to the **!!* DOS keyboard handling. All you have to
do is Display the LEDs, scan the keys, and synchronise the clock. The
last is optional but games will be hard if you don't....

To load an image, run it from the command line (DOS) e.g. MK14 CLOCK.HEX
In windows, you can either associate .HEX files with WK14.EXE or drop
.HEX files onto the Emulator window (WK14 supports drag and drop).

Keys to use
===========

0-9,A-F Hexadecimal Keys
T       Term
M       Mem
G       Go
Z       Abort
R       Reset
/       Quit (DOS)
ESC     Quit (Windows)
G       Start MK14 Emulator (Windows)
LClick  Start/Stop MK14 Emulator (Windows)

Moving the mouse a reasonable distance will also pause the windows emulation.

This emulator will not be developed further, apart from bug fixing. If you
wish to port (to say Unix) and are confused, feel free to email me. If
someone produces another port I would like to have at least a link to it
on my site.
